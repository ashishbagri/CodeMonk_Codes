/**
 * You are given number of nodes, N N, and number of edges, M M, of a undirected
 * connected graph. After adding each edge, print the size of all the connected
 * components (in increasing order).
 * 
 * Input: First line contains two integers, N N and M M, number of nodes and
 * number of edges. Next M M lines contains two integers each, X X and Y Y,
 * denoting that there is an edge between X X and Y Y.
 * 
 * Output: For each edge, print the size of all the connected components (in
 * increasing order) after adding that edge.
 * 
 * Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 3 1≤N≤103 1 ≤ M ≤ N − 1 1≤M≤N−1 1 ≤ X , Y ≤ N 1≤X,Y≤N
